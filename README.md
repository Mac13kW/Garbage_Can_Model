Garbage_Can_Model ver 4.0
=================

This is the recreation of the Cohen, March and Olsen (1972) Garbage Can Model of
organizational decision making using Python 2.7.6 and numpy

I wanted to recreate the model and rewrite it in Python to better understand how it works.
I don't know Fortran but I managed to use the original code from the Appendix as a guide
in building the model. 

For those interested in how the model works I would point you to the original article first.
You can then use the Python model I created to recreate the original results and play
with the assumptions. Wherever possible I tried to preserve the original names of variables,
vectors and matrices.

You will need numpy, random and xlwt
